Send me all your monero, maybe
’Cause I’m beggin’

I’m beggin’, beggin’ you
So pay that ransom, won’t you, maybe
I’m beggin’, beggin’ you
Or I’ll need a real job, darling

Ridin’ high when I was “leet”
I phished them hard and fast, ’cause I had every cheat
I walked away, though you told me “Don’t go”
But easy come and easy go—my funds sank low

So anytime I spam, you shut me out
Anytime I scam, you shrug and doubt
Any lead I chase, you see right through
But I can’t bail out—don’t know what else to do

I’m on my knees when I’m beggin’
’Cause I don’t want to lose you
Hey yeah, ra-ta-ta-ta

’Cause I’m beggin’, beggin’ you
Send me all your monero, maybe
I’m beggin’, beggin’ you
Keep me from that nine-to-five, darling

I need you to understand
Tried so hard to be the big scam-man
The sort that never needs a plan
Only then can I dodge a working stand

An empty rig is all I see
The shadow of my glory is mockin’ me
A broken trojan I can’t deploy
Can’t even fool the devil—my code’s a toy

What we doin’? What’s this chasing?
Why the basement? Why the pacing?
We had decent scripts, didn’t embrace ’em
Now my wallet’s drained and I can’t replace ’em

On the wrong track from something good
I still dream up big wins like I once thought I could
Like a heart that’s beating as it should
You can slam it shut or pay me—I’m misunderstood

But I keep spamming on, keep forging forms
Keep hoping for that sweet reward
I’m stuck at home
’Cause Dad’s upstairs, I’m under his throne
Cause, I’m beggin’

Mm, yeah, I’m beggin’, beggin’ you
So pay that ransom, won’t you, maybe
I’m beggin’, beggin’ you
’Cause I’m too broke to keep on stalling

I’m fightin’ hard to hold this con
Just can’t crack it all alone
I’m hangin’ on; can’t roll it back
My final chunk of code might fade to black

I’m beggin’, beggin’ you
Send me all your monero, maybe
I’m beggin’, beggin’ you
Even 5 bucks, would be crazy, darling

I’m beggin’, beggin’ you
Stop me going legit, (oh) please
I’m beggin’, beggin’ you
Babushka is gonna end me, darling

I’m beggin’, beggin’ you
So pay that ransom, won’t you, maybe
I’m beggin’, beggin’ you
Don’t make me clock in daily!
