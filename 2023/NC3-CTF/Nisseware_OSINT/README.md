From the previous challs, we found this pastebin on their pastebin profile: https://pastebin.com/hQcmjWHL

Running Sherlock on HrM0rt3ns3n, gives us a Twitter profile, where he posted this: https://fxtwitter.com/HrM0rt3ns3n/status/1723026150006325482?s=20

This points us to Mastodon: https://mastodon.social/@M0rt3ns3n

And there we find the ring leader, N1ss3f4r: https://mastodon.social/@n1ss3f4r

We find the first parts of the flag here, `:.$gaAh%;0R$k_BJT` -> :.$gaAh%;0R$k_BJT base85 -> `NC3{f0ll0w_7h3`

We then find their infosec mastodon accounts: https://infosec.exchange/@n1ss3f4r

And then we get the full flag: `NC3{f0ll0w_7h3_wh1t3_w4bb1t}`
