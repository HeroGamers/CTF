# Firebird Training 2023
Challenges used in HKUST COMP2633 for 2023 (good luck to the authors next year with changing the challs :D )

There will not be a lot of in-depth documentation given, and some challenges might even be missing if I don't want to save it (or if it's just web chall where I don't download the source script afterwards, which I don't unless I really need it).

- Homework 4-B: Simple Encryption
- Attendence 5 (I forgor)
- Homework 5-A: Brainfork
- Homework 6-B: A very secured network
