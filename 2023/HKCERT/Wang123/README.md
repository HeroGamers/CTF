" fake flag is faker than real flag, so what is the real flag? "

In the image it looks like we have Wang tiles for a turing machine with paper instructions.. hmm.. and on the right side we see the output of the machine to the input "fake", which is "faker", so maybe we have to use the same machine with "real", as the description hints at?

Looks like the output has been generated by this: https://github.com/nst/WangTilesTuringMachines/

So, now the hard part is to copy the machine from the image.

After meticulous copying by hand (cause a script would've taken longer to write than to do it by hand), we get the flag:
