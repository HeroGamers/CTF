# HKCERT CTF 2023

In 2023 I participated in HKCERT CTF 2023 in the Open Category in a one-man team under DTUHAX (no one else wanted to join me :( ).

I ended up with 3470 points, landing me in #10 on the Open Category and #26 out of everyone (including international teams).

If I solved a challenge, the solution *should* be provided in one of the folders in this subdirectory, however some of them are just challenge files with my half-done solutions to challenges I gave up on.
