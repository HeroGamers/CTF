We can see on Scratch that there is some logic for generating a flag depending on getting the shortest path to the goal in the maze. There's quite a lot of mazes, wow.

We can open the Scratch file with an archive tool like 7zip to unzip it, and boom we get all the mazes.

For A\* we can either easily steal some code online or use some old code (I just used an old implementation I made at my university).

The hardest part for me was honestly getting the images correctly parsed into a graph due to the funny indexing when using opencv, and cause I keep forgetting they switch x and y around...

But hey, run it and after maybe 4 minutes ur done!
