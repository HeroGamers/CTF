At the bottom of https://www.cybermesterskaberne.dk/landsholdet/ there is a picture of the two head coaches of the danish national team. Adam B. Hansen and Jens Myrup.

A little known fact about this picture is that when suggesting the time and place to take it, Jens made no indication to Adam that he would be bringing sunglasses. Then on the day, Jens declared that for "the best lighting" the picture had to be taken staring directly into the sun.

As such, Adam had to squint through the pain of the blindingly bright sunlight, while Jens got to look effortlessly cool.

Life truly is profoundly unfair.
