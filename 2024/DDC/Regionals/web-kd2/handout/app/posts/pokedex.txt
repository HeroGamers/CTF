Psyduck is a yellow Pokémon resembling a duck or a bipedal CTF player. On top of its head are three thick strands of black hair. Psyduck's eyes seem vacant and have tiny pupils. Its legs and tail are stubby.

Psyduck is constantly stunned by its headache and is unable to think very clearly. It usually stands immobile, trying to calm its headache. However, when its headache becomes too severe, Psyduck releases tension in the form of loudly complaining about unfair ctf challenges. The use of these powers produces brain waves identical to those seen in pwn players who haven't slept in over 24 hours, and the Pokémon is unable to recall these episodes.
