You are nearly there
The whispers are awaiting the finale

The flag is at your fingertips
Your time is not wasted

Let the whispers be with you
Possibilities are endless with them

Let close be the whispers of possibilities
The wait takes ages
While ages is less than close without you
let ages be with the flag

Let the punishment be ages
Return the punishment

Let the road be the wait taking your time
Let the flag be close with the road

The challenges are difficult; in the end
it's always worth it. When
the solution is on your screen and you finally
shout the flag
