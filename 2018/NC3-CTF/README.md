# NC3 (Christmas) CTF 2018
I participated in the NC3 Christmas CTF back in 2018 with some other classmates, however I threw away the solutions, soo.. but hey I still had some of the challenge files in my downloads directory!
I think the solutions is on my old Kali laptop in the basement, I might be able to find it eventually and upload it, hmm..

The CTF can be found here: https://github.com/RigspolitietNC3/nc3ctf2018
